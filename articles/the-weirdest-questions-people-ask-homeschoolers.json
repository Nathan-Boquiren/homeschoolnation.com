        "text": "If you’re a homeschooler, you’ve probably been hit with some weird questions. Sure, the classic 'What about socialization?' makes its rounds, but sometimes, people take it to a whole new level. It’s like they think homeschoolers live in underground bunkers, have never seen a textbook, and are completely unaware of how the world works. So today, let’s take a look at some of the funniest, weirdest, and most baffling questions people ask homeschoolers."

        "section": "'Do You Even Have Friends?'",
        "text": "Ah, the age-old assumption that homeschoolers live in total isolation, completely cut off from human interaction. Yes, we have friends. No, they are not imaginary (well, most of the time). The real question is, why do people assume friendship is only possible within the walls of a traditional school? Homeschoolers make friends in co-ops, at church, in sports, online, and—get this—in the actual world, where we interact with people of all ages. Shocking, I know."

        "section": "'Do You Get to Do School in Your Pajamas?'",
        "text": "The short answer? Sometimes. The longer answer? It depends on the homeschooler. Some have structured schedules with actual dress codes (yes, really). Others fully embrace the pajama lifestyle. But let’s be honest—if public schoolers had the option to do algebra in comfy pants and fuzzy socks, they’d take it in a heartbeat."

        "section": "'How Do You Take Tests? Does Your Mom Just Give You an A?'",
        "text": "I love the idea that homeschool moms just hand out grades like Oprah: 'You get an A! And you get an A!' But no, that’s not how it works. Homeschoolers take tests like everyone else—sometimes at home, sometimes through online programs, and sometimes at testing centers. And yes, we actually study for them. Crazy, right?"
      },
      {
        "section": "'Are You, Like, Really Smart or Something?'",
        "text": "Look, not every homeschooler is a genius. Sure, some homeschoolers graduate early or have crazy impressive achievements, but most of us are just regular students. Some subjects click, others don’t. Just because we learn at home doesn’t mean we all have a PhD by 16. But hey, we’ll take the compliment!"

      {
        "section": "'Do You Even Know What (Insert Pop Culture Reference) Is?'",
        "text": "Apparently, some people think homeschoolers live in a pop culture vacuum, completely unaware of music, movies, and social media. Newsflash: We watch movies, listen to music, and use the internet just like everyone else. Sure, some homeschool families avoid certain media, but it’s not like we’re completely clueless. We probably know more memes than we should."

      {
        "section": "'Are You Gonna Be Homeschooled for College Too?'",
        "text": "Yes, someone has actually asked this. While online college is a thing, homeschoolers go to regular universities just like everyone else. And fun fact: Many colleges actually love homeschoolers because we’re self-motivated, independent learners. Who knew?"

      {
        "section": "Conclusion",
        "text": "At the end of the day, these questions might be a little ridiculous, but they also make for some great stories. And honestly? We get it—homeschooling is different, and people are curious. So the next time someone asks if you have friends or if your mom gives you straight A’s, just smile, answer with a little humor, and maybe—just maybe—educate them on what homeschooling is really like."
